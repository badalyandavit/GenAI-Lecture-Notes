The main textbook referenced for information is "Prince, S. J. (2023). Understanding Deep Learning. United Kingdom MIT Press"

The chapters in the repository is not meant to be a comprehensive guide, but rather a combination of (1) useful cheat-sheets and (2) interesting properties of neural networks. Thus, the repository assumes understanding in Calculus, Linear Algebra, Probability, and basics of Machine Learning

Note: Some math notations don't load properly on GitHub. I used Obsidian, although the same scripts can be used in any LaTeX editor (with proper packages)
